    "## **Plant Species Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Juniperus scopulorum* Sargent, also known as Rocky Mountain Juniper \n",
    "Tree, is a coniferous tree that slowly grows to about 20 feet at 20 years \n",
    "but can grow up to 50 feet mature (U.S. Department of Agriculture - \n",
    "Natural Resources Conservation Service 2025). It also has a long life \n",
    "span with high drought tolerance which works to its favor in semi-airid \n",
    "climates like that of the Eastern Colorado Plains (U.S. Department of \n",
    "Agriculture -  Natural Resources Conservation Service 2025). It is native to \n",
    "North America throughout the Rocky Mountain region between British Colombia \n",
    "and Alberta, Canada all the way south through the continental U.S. to the \n",
    "four corner states and east through some of the Great Plains states \n",
    "(Stevens 2008). The Rocky Mountain juniper grows best below elevations \n",
    "of 7,500 feet, but typically between 5,000 and 7,500 feet (U.S. Department \n",
    "of Agriculture - Natural Resources Conservation Service 2002). While the \n",
    "Rocky Mountain juniper is frequently used as an ornamental tree or shrub \n",
    "tree in wildlife plantings and shelterbelts, it is also used by a range \n",
    "of birds and mammals for its ground cover or nesting materials (Stevens 2002). \n",
    "The Rocky Mountain junipers' berries also provide an important part of \n",
    "both bird and mammal diets (Stevens 2002). Additionaly, First Peoples have \n",
    "used this berries from this juniper for tea and other applications \n",
    "for medicinal purposes (Stevens 2008). Some potential problems or concerns \n",
    "about this tree/shrub tree are that it carries cedar-apple rust disease which \n",
    "is not harmful to itself but is harmful to other tree species (U.S. Department of \n",
    "Agriculture - Natural Resources Conservation Service 2002). Beyond diseases, \n",
    "the Rocky Mountain juniper increases are \"at the expense of other ecosystems, \n",
    "such as shrublands, grasslands, riparian forests, and open pine and oak \n",
    "forests, with consequent impacts on plant and wildlife species that flourish \n",
    "in open or unique ecosystems\" (Hanberry 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "This species was chosen because of its prevelance in both the Pawnee National \n",
    "Grassland and the Comanche National Grassland. For the Pawnee National Grassland, \n",
    "the 'General Technical Report' from the USDA, Forest Service on *Vascular Plant* \n",
    "*Species of the Pawnee National Grassland* states that the *Juniperus scopulorum* \n",
    "Sargent occurs in the cliffs and ravines of this National Grassland (Hazlett \n",
    "1998). Similarly in the Comanche National Grassland, this same type of technical \n",
    "report states that *Juniperus scopulorum* Sargent occurs in all 3 counties \n",
    "(Baca, Otero, and Las Animas Counties) that this grassland is in, which also \n",
    "grow in \"shaded rocky canyons and ravines\" and \"Rocky: exposed limestone/shale \n",
    "barrens\" (Hazlett 2004). Because this species is expanding habitats, I am curious \n",
    "to see what the outcome of the habitat suitability model will be. \n",
    "This project could be done with any plant species of choice and could \n",
    "even be adapted to animal habitat suitability, but using other datasets \n",
    "and variables that would pertain to that species or locations of study areas chosen. \n",
    "\n",
    "Considering its growth conditions, *Juniperus scopulorum* Sargent has optimal \n",
    "pH values between 8.5 (max) and 5 (min), and annual precipitation between 26 \n",
    "inches and 9 inches (66cm - 23cm), and  (U.S. Department of Agriculture -  Natural \n",
    "Resources Conservation Service 2025). Root depths at a minimum are 9 inches (23cm) \n",
    "and the minimum temperature is -38 (°F) (U.S. Department of Agriculture -  Natural \n",
    "Resources Conservation Service 2025). While there are other factors that could be \n",
    "taken into consideration for growth, those are the two variables that will be \n",
    "chosen for this project. To look at other growth condition factors as well as \n",

    "The Comanche National Grassland \"is named in honor of the Comanche tribe. \n",
    "The Comanche name is believed to be derived from Komontcia, a Ute word that\n",
    "means 'People Who Fight Us All the Time' (Pritzker 2000). This nickname, \n",
    "assigned by the Utes, reflects the Comanche reputation among other tribes \n",
    "and among pioneers as fierce fighters\" (Hazlett 2004, page 3). Between the \n",
    "18th and 19th centuries there were many 'claims' to this land where the \n",
    "Comanche National Grassland currently is situated by absentee ownership \n",
    "of the U.S., France, and Mexico, but by 1853 the Comanche were 'asked' \n",
    "(forced) to sign a 'treaty', which ceded any remaining lands that were \n",
    "not previously ceded (taken)(Hazlett 2004, pages 1-4). Thus the \n",
    "\"remaining Comanche groups in southeastern Colorado had lost their homeland \n",
    "and lifestyle\" (Hazlett 2004, page 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "After the Dust Bowl resulted in much abandoned farmland the \"National\n",
    "Industrial Act and Emergency Relief Appropriations Act that passed \n",
    "Congress in 1933 and 1935 gave the Federal government the authority \n",
    "to purchase failed crop lands\" (Worster 2004). It wasn't until 1954 \n",
    "that \"the administration of these lands was transferred to the \n",
    "USDA-Forest Service\" (Hazlett 2004, page 4). In 1960 the Comanche\n",
    "National Grassland was created to be managed by the USDA-Forest Service \n",
    "to conserve \"the natural resources of grass, water and wildlife habitat(s)\" \n",
    "and protect prehistoric and historic, cultural and natural assets \n",
    "(U.S. Department of Agriculture , U.S. Forest Service 2014). It consists \n",
    "of around 440,000 acres of discontinuous land that is located in the \n",
    "corner of southeastern Colorado (U.S. Department of Agriculture , U.S. \n",
    "Forest Service 2014). This grassland is situated between three different \n",
    "Colorado counties: Baca, Otero, and Las Animas and can be further identified \n",
    "as two distinct units the *Carrizo Unit* south and west of Springfield \n",
    "and the *Timpas Unit* south of La Junta\" (Hazlett 2004, page 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Comanche National Grassland is within what most plant geographers \n",
    "classify as the 'North American Prairie Province' (Hazlett 2004, page 5). \n",
    "Rockey Mountain junipers grow in 'rocky outcrops' which \"are areas within \n",
    "the open steppe, such as hilltops, where erosion has exposed a rocky surface \n",
    "or barren (Hazlett 2004, page 8 and 17). A “barren” is defined here, in \n",
    "a broad sense, as a sparsely vegetated exposed bedrock of shale, shale-derived \n",
    "soils, chalk, or limestone soils with microorganisms in a calcite matrix \n",
    "(Kelso et al. 2003). They also grow in the Comanche National Grassland in \n",
    "'shaded rock canyons and ravines' which are characterized as \"the steep, rugged \n",
    "relief areas that comprise the rocky cliffs, rock slicks, and shaded ledges \n",
    "in the major canyons... Included here are hills with large boulders \n",
    "and steep ridges... The greater water availability along cliff faces is \n",
    "complemented by less evaporation due to greater amounts of shade. This is a \n",
    "habitat of deep water percolation and occasional shade\" (Hazlett 2004, page \n",
    "8 and 17). Due to the vast expanse of land the Comanche National Grassland \n",
    "occupies (over 100 miles from one end to the other) the \"Annual rainfall amounts \n",

    "## **Methods Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "With the goal of building a habitat suitability model, there are \n",
    "many steps that need to happen prior to being able to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define study area(s):** Download the \n",
    "[USFS National Grassland Units](https://data-usfs.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/usfs::national-grassland-units-feature-layer/explore?location=39.118879%2C-104.194688%2C7.05) \n",
    "and select 1 or more grassland units.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - I chose Comanche and Pawnee Nation Grasslands as study sites. \n",
    "    The USFS National Grassland Units are 'administrative boundaries' \n",
    "    and this data is used to bound and crop the 3 sets of raster data \n",
    "    being used in this project as well as provide boundaries when plots \n",
    "    are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fit a model:** \n",
    "\n",
    "    a. For each grassland, download model variables as raster \n",
    "    layers covering the study area envelope, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. 1 soil variable from the \n",
    "    [POLARIS dataset](http://hydrology.cee.duke.edu/POLARIS/PROPERTIES/v1.0/) \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - I chose pH. Using this \n",
    "    raster data will provide insight into this soil property in the \n",
    "    study areas chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ii. Elevation from the [SRTM](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) \n",
    "    (use the \n",
    "    [earthaccess API](https://earthaccess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-reference/api/api/))\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This will be used to calculate slope later. For the Rocky Mountain \n",
    "    Juniper, they are frequently located in ravines, canyons, and \n",
    "    rocky barrens, so they woulc be located in areas with steep slopes,\n",
    "    or where are are drastic differences in slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Calculate at least one derived topographic variable (slope or aspect)** \n",
    "    to use in the model. Use the xarray-spatial library, and update or install this \n",
    "    library if not already on machine being used. Note that calculated slope may \n",
    "    not be correct if using a CRS with units of degrees; need to re-project into \n",
    "    a projected coordinate system with units of meters, such as the appropriate \n",
    "    UTM Zone. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - I am choosing slope for this project because it more closely relates to \n",
    "    where the Rocky Mountain Juniper is found in the Comanche and Pawnee National \n",
    "    Grasslands. It is found in ravines, canyons, and rocky barrens, so the slope \n",
    "    would possibly provide more information in the habitat suitablity model.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    iii. Climate variables from the \n",
    "    [MACAv2](https://climate.northwestknowledge.net/MACA/index.php) [THREDDS](https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/tds/4.6/adminguide/#:~:text=The%20THREDDS%20Data%20Server%20(TDS,other%20remote%20data%20access%20protocols)) \n",
    "    data server. This project will use 16 climate scenarios \n",
    "    of choice (e.g. different time periods, different emission \n",
    "    scenarios).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Time Periods Chosen**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Two different time periods are chosen *'historical' (1970-1999)* and \n",
    "        *late 21st century* (2071-2099). These specific years match up with the \n",
    "        individual file start and end years of the MACAv2 data. This route was chosen \n",
    "        because it will aid in the analysis of suitable habitats for the Rocky \n",
    "        Mountatin Juniper in both of the study areas chosen (Comanche and Pawnee \n",
    "        National Grasslands) that are roughly 100 years apart. Different time periods \n",
    "        provide insight into the past as well as possible future scenarios and the \n",
    "        two can be compared to look at the validity of the habitat suitability model \n",
    "        to be created for this project. Also, because the  detailed research sources \n",
    "        I found were from 1998 and 2004, those years fall within the 'historical' time \n",
    "        frame and the research can also be used to validate the habitat suitability \n",
    "        model regarding the 'historical' time period (Hazlett 1998 and 2004). The \n",
    "        MACA data can be downloaded as daily or monthly, and for the purposes of \n",
    "        this project, monthly will suffice, the amount of data the daily dataset \n",
    "        would have, is not necessary here. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Climate Models Chosen: Reasoning**\n",
    "        - Constant variables/scenarios of - RCP 8.5 as the Emission Scenario, \n",
    "        Climate Variables of precipitation and temperature minimum (°F). \n",
    "        The RCP8.5 Emission Scenario was chosen because that is the worst \n",
    "        case scenario for emissions and given that these two grasslands are \n",
    "        geographically close, I am interested in the most extreme emissions \n",
    "        scenario to see if that helps with the habitat model picking up on \n",
    "        differences that could be compared in the two grasslands. Those climate \n",
    "        varibales were chosen because that is information I could find about \n",
    "        the Rocky Mountain Juniper's growth conditions. In theory, if available, \n",
    "        I would be interested in the temperature max it can tolerate as well, \n",
    "        but that couldn't be found given the research sources I am using.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Using the Future Climate Scatter from the Climate Toolbox I chose 4\n",
    "        climate models for each time period that was previously decided upon \n",
    "        (University of California MERCED n.d., \"Climate Toolbox\").\n",
    "        Within each time period what I am trying to do is pick climate models \n",
    "        where the two warm scenarios are close in temperature, the two cold's \n",
    "        are close in temperature, the precipitation for dry is close, the \n",
    "        precipitation for wet is close. The goal of that is to have as little \n",
    "        variation within the time period, so more can hopefully be explained \n",
    "        by the climate model rather than the variation in the temp or precipitation.\n",
    "        A full list of the specific climate models are available\n",
    "        [here](https://climate.northwestknowledge.net/MACA/GCMs.php), and this \n",

    "- To train a fuzzy logic habitat suitability model:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use research done on the plant species chosen (Rocky Mountain Juniper), \n",
    "    and find the optimal values for each variable being used \n",
    "    (e.g. soil pH (5-8.5), slope (5,000-7,500ft elevation), and current \n",
    "    climatological annual precipitation (9 inches - 26 inches, 228.6 - 660.4 mm).\n",
    "    For each digital number in each raster, assign a value from 0 to 1 for \n",
    "    how close that grid square is to the optimum range (1=optimal, 0=incompatible). \n",
    "    Combine raster layers by multiplying them together \n",
    "    ([raster math](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/use-data-open-source-python/intro-raster-data-python/raster-data-processing/subtract-rasters-in-python/)). \n",
    "    This will output a single suitability number for each square. \n",
    "    Another option would be to apply a  threshold to make the most \n",
    "    suitable areas pop on the map created.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Present the results of the model** in at least one figure for each \n",
    "grassland/climate scenario combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The output raster from the fuzzy logic habitat suitability model \n",
