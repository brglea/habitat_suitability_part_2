    "a tree native to the Rocky Mounatin Region of North America. This habitat suitability \n",
    "model will focus on creating a modular, reproducible workflow. While climate change \n",
    "has changed or taken away suitable habitats for some plant species, the Rocky Mountain Juniper \n",
    "has remained stable and is even expaning habitat areas eastward (Hanberry 2022). However, \n",
    "this is at the expense of other ecosystems. Some climate change scenarios \n",
    "predict up to 90% loss of suitable habitats native grass species like *Sorghastrum nutans* \n",
    "(Kane et al. 2017). So, when thinking about grassland restoration, the \n",
    "effects of climate change and expanding species like *Juniperus scopulorum* \n",
    "Sargent must be taken into consideration for long-term viability of \n",

    "\n",
    "*Juniperus scopulorum* Sargent, also known as Rocky Mountain Juniper \n",
    "Tree, is a coniferous tree that slowly grows to about 20 feet at 20 years \n",
    "but can grow up to 50 feet mature (Characteristics of *Juniperus* \n",
    "*scopulorum* Sarg., USDA, NRCS). It also has a long life span with \n",
    "high drought tolerance which works to its favor in semi-airid climates \n",
    "like that of the Eastern Colorado Plains (Characteristics of \n",
    "*Juniperus scopulorum* Sarg., USDA, NRCS). It is native to North America \n",
    "throughout the Rocky Mountain region between British Colombia and Alberta,\n",
    "Canada all the way south through the continental U.S. to the four corners\n",
    "states and east through some of the Great Plains states (Stevens, 2008). \n",
    "The Rocky Mountain juniper grows best below elevations of 7,500 feet, \n",
    "but typically between 5,000 and 7,500 feet (Plant Materials Program, 2002). \n",
    "While the Rocky Mountain juniper is frequently used as an ornamental \n",
    "tree or shrub tree in wildlife plantings and shelterbelts, it is also \n",
    "used by a range of birds and mammals for its ground cover or nesting \n",
    "materials. The Rocky Mountain junipers' berries also provide an important \n",
    "part of both bird and mammal diets. Additionaly, First Peoples have \n",
    "used this berries from this juniper for tea and other applications \n",
    "for medicinal purposes (Stevens, 2008). Some potential problems or concerns \n",
    "about this tree/shrub tree are that it carries cedar-apple rust disease which \n",
    "is not harmful to itself but is harmful to other tree species (Plant \n",
    "Materials Program, 2002). Beyond diseases, the Rocky Mountain juniper increases \n",
    "are \"at the expense of other ecosystems, such as shrublands, grasslands, \n",
    "riparian forests, and open pine and oak forests, with consequent impacts on \n",
    "plant and wildlife species that flourish in open or unique ecosystems\" \n",
    "(Hanberry, B., 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "This species was chosen because of its prevelance in both the Pawnee National \n",

    "grow in \"shaded rocky canyons and ravines\" and \"Rocky: exposed limestone/shale \n",
    "barrens\" (Hazlett, 2004). Because this species is expanding habitats, I am curious \n",
    "to see what the outcome of the habitat suitability model will be. \n",
    "This project could be done with any plant species of choice and could \n",
    "even be adapted to animal habitat suitability, but using other datasets \n",
    "and variables that would pertain to that species or locations of study areas chosen. \n",
    "\n",
    "Considering its growth conditions, *Juniperus scopulorum* Sargent has optimal \n",
    "pH values between 8.5 (max) and 5 (min), and annual precipitation between 26 \n",
    "inches and 9 inches (66cm - 23cm) (Characteristics of *Juniperus scopulorum* Sarg.,\n",

    "## **Methods Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "With the goal of building a habitat suitability model, there are \n",
    "many steps that need to happen prior to being able to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define study area(s):** Download the \n",
    "[USFS National Grassland Units](https://data-usfs.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/usfs::national-grassland-units-feature-layer/explore?location=39.118879%2C-104.194688%2C7.05) \n",
    "and select 1 or more grassland units.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - I chose Comanche and Pawnee Nation Grasslands as study sites. \n",
    "    The USFS National Grassland Units are 'administrative boundaries' \n",
    "    and this data is used to bound and crop the 3 sets of raster data \n",
    "    being used in this project as well as provide boundaries when plots \n",
    "    are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fit a model:** \n",
    "\n",
    "    a. For each grassland, download model variables as raster \n",
    "    layers covering the study area envelope, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. 1 soil variable from the \n",
    "    [POLARIS dataset](http://hydrology.cee.duke.edu/POLARIS/PROPERTIES/v1.0/) \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - I chose pH. Using this \n",
    "    raster data will provide insight into this soil property in the \n",
    "    study areas chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ii. Elevation from the [SRTM](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) \n",
    "    (use the \n",
    "    [earthaccess API](https://earthaccess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-reference/api/api/))\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This will be used to calculate slope later. For the Rocky Mountain \n",
    "    Juniper, they are frequently located in ravines, canyons, and \n",
    "    rocky barrens, so they woulc be located in areas with steep slopes,\n",
    "    or where are are drastic differences in slope.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    iii. 1 climate variable from the \n",
    "    [MACAv2](https://climate.northwestknowledge.net/MACA/index.php) [THREDDS](https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/tds/4.6/adminguide/#:~:text=The%20THREDDS%20Data%20Server%20(TDS,other%20remote%20data%20access%20protocols)) \n",
    "    data server. This project will compare two climate scenarios \n",
    "    of choice (e.g. different time periods, different emission \n",
    "    scenarios).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - I chose the CCSM4 climate model, using the precipitation \n",
    "    variable, and two climate scenarios - historical and rcm85.\n",
    "    The model was chosen to best match the resolution of the other \n",
    "    raster data being used in this project and because NCAR is in \n",
    "    Colorado and I think data from NCAR has been used in other projects\n",
    "    I've done. The climate variable \n",
    "    precipitation was chosen because optimal levels of it were found \n",
    "    in researching the Rocky Mountatin Juniper. Those two climate \n",
    "    scenarios were chosen because choosing one model as the actual/\n",
    "    historical scenario and comparing to a future scenario is helpful \n",
    "    in evaluating if the model can make predictions that are more \n",
    "    reliable (Global Percipitation Measuremet Mission, NASA). \n",
    "\n",
    "    b. **Calculate at least one derived topographic variable (slope or aspect)** \n",
    "    to use in the model. Use the xarray-spatial library, and update or install this \n",
    "    library if not already on machine being used. Note that calculated slope may \n",
    "    not be correct if using a CRS with units of degrees; need to re-project into \n",
    "    a projected coordinate system with units of meters, such as the appropriate \n",
    "    UTM Zone. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - I am choosing slope for this project because it more closely relates to \n",
    "    where the Rocky Mountain Juniper is found in the Comanche and Pawnee National \n",
    "    Grasslands. It is found in ravines, canyons, and rocky barrens, so the slope \n",
    "    would possibly provide more information in the habitat suitablity model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    c. **Harmonize data** - make sure that the grids for each of the layers \n",
    "    match up. Check out the ds.rio.reproject_match() method from rioxarray.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This step is very important. The model cannot be built if the different \n",
    "    layers are off or on different grids; they have to relate to one another \n",
    "    in order to do the raster math in the next step. The data will be harmonized \n",
    "    to the lowest resolution raster of the group, higher resolution can be made \n",
    "    into a lower resolution, but not vice versa. Although this may sound bad, \n",
    "    most of the rasters chosen are around 1x1 degrees so there should in theory \n",
    "    not be a huge depreciation in resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Build habitat suitability model** - use any model, so long as the choice of model \n",
    "is explained. However, if it is not clear how to proceed, building a fuzzy \n",
    "logic model (see below) is best. I will be doing a fuzzy logic model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To train a fuzzy logic habitat suitability model:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use research done on the plant species chosen (Rocky Mountain Juniper), \n",
    "    and find the optimal values for each variable being used \n",
    "    (e.g. soil pH (5-8.5), slope (5,000-7,500ft elevation), and current \n",
    "    climatological annual precipitation (9 inches - 26 inches, 228.6 - 660.4 mm).\n",
    "    For each digital number in each raster, assign a value from 0 to 1 for \n",
    "    how close that grid square is to the optimum range (1=optimal, 0=incompatible). \n",
    "    Combine raster layers by multiplying them together \n",
    "    ([raster math](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/use-data-open-source-python/intro-raster-data-python/raster-data-processing/subtract-rasters-in-python/)). \n",
    "    This will output a single suitability number for each square. \n",
    "    Another option would be to apply a  threshold to make the most \n",
    "    suitable areas pop on the map created.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Present the results of the model** in at least one figure for each \n",
    "grassland/climate scenario combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The output raster from the fuzzy logic habitat suitability model \n",
    "    will be used with the overlay of the boundaries of the study area.\n",
    "    Multiple plots will be made to account for each grassland/climate 'scenario, \n",
    "    so there should be 4 plots to finish the concluding thoughts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The climate scenarios chosen, actual/historical and worst case scenario are \n",
    "particularly important in this habitat suitability model because if the model \n",
    "can't predict obeservations made in real life then it is less likely \"that a \n",
